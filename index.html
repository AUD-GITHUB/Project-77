            <p>The Console object provides access to the browser's debugging console.

                Console object methods: 

                assert()	        Writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false
                clear()	            Clears the console
                count()	            Logs the number of times that this particular call to count() has been called
                error()	            Outputs an error message to the console
                group()	            Creates a new inline group in the console. This indents following console messages by an additional level, until console.groupEnd() is called
                groupCollapsed()	Creates a new inline group in the console. However, the new group is created collapsed. The user will need to use the disclosure button to expand it

                table()	            Displays tabular data as a table
                time()	            Starts a timer (can track how long an operation takes)
                timeEnd()	        Stops a timer that was previously started by console.time()
                trace()	            Outputs a stack trace to the console
                warn()	            Outputs a warning message to the console
                
                Press Command + Option + J (Mac) or Control + Shift + J 
                (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the Console panel.
